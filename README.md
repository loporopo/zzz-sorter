Zenless Zone Zero Character Sorter
This is a simple web-based character sorter for the game "Zenless Zone Zero". It allows you to sort your favorite characters by comparing them in a series of head-to-head matchups, ultimately generating a ranked list of your preferences.

Start Sorting: Click the "Start Sorting" button.

Compare Characters: You will be presented with two characters. Click "← Choose A" or "Choose B →" to select your preferred character, or "Tie" if you like both equally.

Undo: If you make a mistake, click the "Undo" button to revert to the previous comparison.

View Results: Once all comparisons are complete, the "Final Ranking" will be displayed, showing your characters sorted by your preferences.
